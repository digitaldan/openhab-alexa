# Amazon Alexa Smart Home skill for openHAB 2

This is a nodejs / lambda application that connects the Alexa Smart Home API to a user's openHAB instance, either directly or through the openHAB Cloud service (preferred).  The Smart Home API is not a general skill API, it allows the user to bypass using a application wake work and instead ask Alexa to perform a smart home action like "Alexa turn lights on"

This is designed to use the Homekit style tags in openHAB 2 to bind a user's devices to Alexa. This does not work with openHAB 1.x because there is no tagging mechanism. If you want to use the Alexa Smart Home skill with openHAB 1, you may use [this fork](https://github.com/paphko/openhab-alexa/tree/oh1_oh2_groups) which uses a group to bind user's devices to Alexa.

# General Installation Instructions

## Requirements

* Amazon AWS account with Alexa and Lambda access
* OAUTH2 Provider (Like Amazon Login)
* A openHAB server that a AWS service endpoint can access

## Skill Configuration

Deployment requires two configuration files, config.js for the application configuration, and .env for the node-lambda deployment app.

### config.js

The app can access a openHAB installation using two different types of authorization, basic auth ("user@password") or with bearer auth (OAUTH2 token).  Uncomment the "userpass" property for basic auth, otherwise a bearer token will be used.

### .env

Enter your AWS credentials, specifically AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_ROLE_ARN.  Other access methods may work as well (AWS_SESSION_TOKEN) but have not been tested.

## Install Steps

### Create Smart Home Skill

Use the following guide to setup amazon, note that the node deployment script publishes to "{AWS_FUNCTION_NAME}-{AWS_ENVIRONMENT}", so you might want to call yours "openhab-development" if your AWS_FUNCTION_NAME = "openhab".  Also choose "nodejs" as the lambda runtime type.

### Create and Deploy Lambda app

* run `npm install` to install the nodejs dependencies
* copy config_sample.js to config.js
* copy env_sample to .env
* change config files to match your environment.
* run "node-lambda deploy"
* login to the amazon lambda console and select the newly created project,
* Under "Event Sources"  add a "smart home skill" event source, for Application Id, add the Application Id from the Alexa developer portal
* copy the ARN value from the very top of the screen.
* login back to the Alexa console and select "configuration"
* Paste the ARN value from your Lambda into the "Lambda ARN" Field
* Fill out OAUTH2 information (from your oauth server or the Amazon Login service. See [this post](https://developer.amazon.com/public/community/post/Tx3CX1ETRZZ2NPC/Alexa-Account-Linking-5-Steps-to-Seamlessly-Link-Your-Alexa-Skill-with-Login-wit) for step-by-step instructions for _Login with Amazon_.)
* MAKE SURE YOU HAVE VALID SSL CERTS AND CERT CHAINS!!!! I highly recommend using Lets Encrypt.
